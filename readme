## Overview
OLAF is an innovative project designed to harness the power of artificial intelligence to enhance the reading experience. It reads books and generates images and text that mimic a visual learner's style. The aim is to provide users with engaging summaries, visual representations, and interactive content that deepens their understanding and appreciation of literature.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Summaries**: Generates concise summaries of books using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
- **Image Generation**: Creates relevant images based on the content of the book, enhancing visual learning.
- **Interactive Learning**: Users can interact with the generated content for a more immersive experience.
- **Wide Range of Genres**: Supports various genres, allowing users to explore diverse literary works.
